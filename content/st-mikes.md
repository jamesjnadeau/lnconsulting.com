				<h3>Student Center and Residence Hall Expansion</h3>
				<h4>Colchester, VT</h4>
				<p>Our company completed the design for the construction of a new Student Center and Residence Hall at St. Michaelâ€™s College.  </p>
				<p>The Student Center is approximately 44,000 sq. ft. and includes dinning, conference, fitness, radio station, and food service programs.  </p>
				<p>The Residence Hall is approximately 49,000 sq. ft.  </p>
				<p>In addition, the project included 12,600 sq. ft. of renovation within existing campus Residence Halls in order to integrate the new Student Center and Residence Hall building within an existing Residence Hall Complex.</p>
				<p>Both new buildings are served by a shared closed loop geothermal water source heat pump system. The project design included; natural light features, geothermal air conditioning, highly energy efficient energy recovery ventilation systems with demand control ventilation, infastructure for future building mounted photovoltaic array with a nominal nameplate rating of approximately 80kW, super-efficient lighting design that includes day light controls, envelope analysis to develop a cost effective/highly efficient building skin, economizer ventilation selection, and detailed mechanical control systems to minimize energy usage through active means. </p>
