   L.N. Consulting completed the first phase design to install up to 45 kW of PV panels on the roof of the Shelburne Farm Barn.  L.N.

The project involved working with Green Mountain Power to verify energy reimbursements and incentives available, as well as all technical requirements including revisions to the building?s existing electrical service.
