				<h3>Waitsfield Residence</h3>
				<h4>Waitsfield, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   The residence has approximately 5000 s.f. of living space and music studio space.  Our design included a geothermal system utilizing a standing column well linked to multiple water to air heat pumps for living spaces, and a water to water heat pump for radiant heat and domestic water heating.  There is a solar domestic water heating system as well.  The ventilation systems implemented comprised of bathroom ventilation, and energy recovery ventilation for the living spaces and music studio.
