				<h3>Crowe Residence</h3>
				<h4>Shelburne, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
  The residence has approximately 8500 s.f. of living space.  L.N. Consulting designed a geothermal system based upon a standing column well linked to multiple water to air heat pumps serving living spaces and a water to water heat pump for radiant heat and domestic water heating.  The home has a gas fired boiler for pool heating and back-up heat.  Our design included bathroom exhaust, energy recovery ventilation for the living spaces, kitchen ventilation system, and a ventilation system for multiple fireplaces.  The project was completed in the spring of 2009.
