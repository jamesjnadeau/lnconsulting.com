				<h3>360 State Street</h3>
				<p>
  				 	L.N. Consulting has recently been retained by an architect/developer to assist with energy efficiency and mechanical and electrical design assistance associated with a 500 unit apartment building with 50,000 sq.ft. of office/retail space in New Haven, Connecticut.  We were responsible for retooling the design of the core HVAC and electrical distribution systems of the building along with terminal equipment for HVAC and lighting systems. The proposed building is 31 stories tall and is fitted with a high efficiency heat pump system with a dual wheel style energy recovery ventilator system for bathroom exhaust/building ventilation.  The building is fitted with a fuel cell which will provide a bulk of the building heat, domestic water heat, pool heat and building electricity.  We worked closely with the design team to incorporate creative energy efficiency methods with respect to heating/heat pump system piping configurations, differential pressure loop controls, and implementation of occupancy and daylight controlled lighting.  The project is receiving a large green building credit from the State of Connecticut due to its leadership in integrated energy efficient design.  The project is registered for LEED Platinum certification.

				<h3>Fuel Cell</h3>
				<p>
  					 L.N. Consulting is providing electrical and mechanical design services to install 400 kW fuel cell for a new 31 floor combination residential/commercial building in downtown New Haven, CT.  This project included preparing the electric service to accommodate the fuel cell and working with the local utility and state agencies to accommodate the additional power supply, including requesting electrical code variances due to the latest technologies involved with fuel cells.  L.N. Consulting also investigated several options for achieving the greatest economic value of the fuel cell, such as implementing a method to provide as much building load to the fuel cell as possible to allow a higher $/kWh return on investment, as well as implementing waste heat for heating and cooling. The project is registered for LEED Platinum certification.
