				<h3>360 State Street Fuel Cell</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting is providing electrical and mechanical design services to install 400 kW fuel cell for a new 31 floor combination residential/commercial building in downtown New Haven, CT.  This project included preparing the electric service to accommodate the fuel cell and working with the local utility and state agencies to accommodate the additional power supply, including requesting electrical code variances due to the latest technologies involved with fuel cells.  L.N. Consulting also investigated several options for achieving the greatest economic value of the fuel cell, such as implementing a method to provide as much building load to the fuel cell as possible to allow a higher $/kWh return on investment, as well as implementing waste heat for heating and cooling. The project is registered for LEED Platinum certification.
