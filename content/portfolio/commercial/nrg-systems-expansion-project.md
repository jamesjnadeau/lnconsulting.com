				<h3>NRG Systems Expansion Project</h3>
				<h4>Hinesburg, VT</h4>
				<p>
   
   NRG Expansion facility design and construction administration.  The facility is a 28,000 sq.ft. office/manufacturing building.  The HVAC system uses geothermal well water cooling for radiant slabs and ventilation air.  System design included high efficiency energy recovery ventilation with demand control distribution, occupancy lighting controls, day lighting controls, natural day light balancing of almost all spaces, domestic water solar heating, pellet wood boilers, 70 kW of PV power production, and natural nighttime outdoor air building cooling/ventilation.  The building is 70% more efficient as compared to a minimally compliant ASHRAE building.  The project has achieved LEED Gold certification and was awarded the Better Building by Design Award in 2009.
