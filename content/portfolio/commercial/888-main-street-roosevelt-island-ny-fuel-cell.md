				<h3>Octagon Apartments Fuel Cell</h3>
				<h4>888 Main Street, Roosevelt, Island, NY, NY</h4>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting provided electrical and mechanical design services to install 400 kW fuel cell to supplement building load to an existing 15 story combination residential/commercial building.  The project included revising the existing electric service to accommodate the fuel cell.  We also acted as an agent to the owner, providing all the applications to the local utility and state code enforcement agencies.  Additionally, L.N. Consulting assisted on retaining NYSERDA grants and incentives, including one that implements the fuel cell as a emergency power source for disaster relief.
